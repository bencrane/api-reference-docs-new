```python
modal.FilePatternMatcher
class FilePatternMatcher(modal.file_pattern_matcher._AbstractPatternMatcher)
```

Allows matching file Path objects against a list of patterns.

Usage:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from modal import FilePatternMatcher

matcher = FilePatternMatcher("*.py")

```

assert matcher(Path("foo.py"))

```python
# You can also negate the matcher.
negated_matcher = ~matcher

```

assert not negated_matcher(Path("foo.py"))
```python
def __init__(self, *pattern: str) -> None:
```

Initialize a new FilePatternMatcher instance.

Args: pattern (str): One or more pattern strings.

Raises: ValueError: If an illegal exclusion pattern is provided.

can_prune_directories
```python
def can_prune_directories(self) -> bool:
```

Returns True if this pattern matcher allows safe early directory pruning.

Directory pruning is safe when matching directories can be skipped entirely without missing any files that should be included. This is for example not safe when we have inverted/negated ignore patterns (e.g. ”!*/.py”).

from_file
@classmethod
```python
def from_file(cls, file_path: Union[str, Path]) -> "FilePatternMatcher":
```

Initialize a new FilePatternMatcher instance from a file.

The patterns in the file will be read lazily when the matcher is first used.

Args: file_path (Path): The path to the file containing patterns.

Usage:

```python
from modal import FilePatternMatcher

matcher = FilePatternMatcher.from_file("/path/to/ignorefile")
```
